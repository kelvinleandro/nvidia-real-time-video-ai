# Optimizing a Video AI Model

### 1. **Choose the correct model development workflow using the TAO Toolkit.**

- **Prepare Data and Download Pretrained Model -> Train -> Evaluate -> Optimize -> Evaluate -> Export -> Deploy**

- Prepare Data and Download Pretrained Model -> Optimize -> Train -> Export -> Deploy -> Evaluate

- Prepare Data and Download Pretrained Model -> Train -> Optimize -> Export -> Deploy

- Prepare Data and Download Pretrained Model -> Train -> Evaluate -> Export -> Deploy -> Optimize

### 2. **Which of the following is not a model optimization feature supported by the TAO Toolkit?**

- Pruning

- Quantization-aware training

- Inference using TensorRT engine

- Data augmentation

- Efficient training using TFRecords

- **Reinforcement learning**

### 3. **Which of the following is false about pretrained models?**

- **Pretrained models always require learning from custom data.**

- NVIDIA's NGCâ„¢ catalog offers both pruned and unpruned pretrained purpose-built models.

- Pretrained models use popular network architectures to train AI models for classification, object detection, and segmentation.

- You can expect more pretrained models to be offered as they become available.

### 4. **Which of the following is false about transfer learning?**

- Is the process of transferring learned features from one application to another.

- Reduces data scarcity issues and time to build a model.

- **Models trained from transfer learning is not as accurate as training from scratch.**

- Can be used for scene adaptation such as a new point of view or camera angle for video AI applications.

### 5. **Which of the following is true about the TAO Toolkit?**

- [x] **A zero-coding, AI training toolkit that makes it easy to start building custom AI models.**
- [x] **Uses transfer learning to reduce cost associated with building AI models.**
- [x] **Offers purpose-built pretrained models that are production ready.**
- [x] **Utilizes a CLI to perform tasks that are configured with spec files.**
